This task demonstrates the integration of a LIDAR sensor, specifically the Delta 2A model.

## Introduction

The integration of a LIDAR sensor provides accurate distance measurements and object detection capabilities, making it suitable for various applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and environmental monitoring.

## How it Works

The LIDAR sensor emits laser pulses and measures the time it takes for the pulses to reflect off objects and return to the sensor. This information is used to calculate distances to objects in the sensor's field of view.

Sensor that uses remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances and create detailed, three-dimensional maps or point clouds of the surroundings. It works by emitting laser pulses and measuring the time it takes for the light to bounce back after hitting an object. providing precise and accurate distance measurements for mapping and navigation.

## Output

Once the LIDAR sensor is successfully integrated and the software algorithms are implemented, the system can be used to measure distances, detect objects, and perform various tasks based on the sensor data.
